# Fed-OGD

This is the code used to generate the experiments in the paper "Fed-OGD: Mitigating Straggler Effects in Federated
Learning via Orthogonal Gradient Descent".

## Setup

1. This implemetation is based on Python3. To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

- torch==1.13.0

- torchtext==1.14.0

- torchvision==1.10.0

- numpy==1.23.5

- sklearn==1.0.1

- matplotlib==3.7.0


2. You can run any models implemented in `./simulation/sim_fed_main.py`. Additionally, you can configure the experimental settings in `option.py`.
